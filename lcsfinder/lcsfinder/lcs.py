"""Compute the longest common subsequence of two strings."""

# TODO: Add the three algorithms that compute the longest common
# subsequence (LCS) of two strings that contain either characters or
# numbers. Make sure to add the required function signatures and
# documentation to ensure that the code is clear and understandable.
# You must add comments that explain the purpose of each of the key
# statements inside of each of the LCS algorithms.
