"""Automatically generate data used for benchmarking."""

# TODO: implement all of the generation functions so that your program can
# generate data according to the requirements in the README.md file. Please
# note that you should be able to generate:
# - strings that contain characters
# - strings that contain numbers
# The strings must always be of the same size. The size of the strings must
# follow the rules associated with running a doubling experiment. You should
# generate the strings and then confirm that it works through test cases.
