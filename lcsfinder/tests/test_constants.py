"""Test suite for the constants module."""

# ruff: noqa: PLR2004

# TODO: implement test cases for any of the constants.
#
# TODO: You also need to implement test cases for:
# - The constant enumeration(s) in the approach module.
# - All of the methods associated data generation
# - All of the methods associated running a benchmark
# - All of the methods associated the LCS algorithms
#
# Ultimately, you should have a test suite for each of
# the individual files inside of the lcsfinder directory.
