## Gregory M. Kapfhammer

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you ran the `systemsense` program

#### First output from running the `systemsense` program

#### Second output from running the `systemsense` program

### Use three fenced code blocks to provide output from all different runs of `lcsfinder` for the three algorithms

#### Provide the command the output for the runs of the `lcsfinder` and the first algorithm

TODO: Provide the complete command-lines for your uses of the `lcsfinder` program

TODO: Provide your own example of command(s) and the output that they produce
TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique configuration of the tool
TODO: Make sure that each run is only for the use of the tool with the specified data structure

#### Provide the command output for the runs of the `lcsfinder` and the second algorithm

TODO: Provide the complete command-lines for your uses of the `lcsfinder` program

TODO: Provide your own example of command(s) and the output that they produce
TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique configuration of the tool
TODO: Make sure that each run is only for the use of the tool with the specified data structure

#### Provide the command output for the runs of the `lcsfinder` and the third algorithm

TODO: Provide the complete command-lines for your uses of the `lcsfinder` program

TODO: Provide your own example of command(s) and the output that they produce
TODO: Make sure that each run is for a unique configuration of the tool
TODO: Make sure that each run is only for the use of the tool with the specified data structure

## Data Tables

TODO: You must add instrumentation using tools like `timeit` to ensure that the
`lcsfinder` calculates and reports the time overhead data that you will need
to complete the entire experiment. Before you conduct your experiments, please
carefully confirm that `lcsfinder` calculates and reports the time overhead
values in a correct fashion.

TODO: Use Markdown to provide one or more data tables that summarize the results
from running the `lcsfinder` program in all possible different configurations.

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Use several paragraphs and/or a list to explain each of the unique
configurations for which it is possible to run the `lcsfinder` program. Please
note that, for this algorithm engineering project, you are required to run the
`lcsfinder` tool in all possible valid configurations so that you can carefully
study the performance of all the key algorithms provided in the `lcs.py` file.
You need to make sure that you specific values for `--startsize` and `--runs`
that ensure the `lcsfinder` will report performance results that help you to
accurately characterize the worst-case time complexity of the each algorithm for
finding the longest common subsequence of two strings. Your performance analysis
should also investigate whether or not the use of `int` or `char` data
influences the performance of the algorithms that find the LCS.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!

TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY discuss the empirical results! You must also
state and explain the worst-case time complexities for each of the stated
methods!

## Professional Development

### Overall, what are the trade-offs associated with using a different algorithmic approaches to finding the longest common subsequence?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate the performance of LCS finding?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions. The takeaways that you write should be specifically
connected to the system that you implemented and the experiments that you
conducted.
